*Position your brand as a leader in the field of bird science and conservation!*

We invite you to partner with the Society of Canadian Ornithologists to advance scientific research and conservation efforts for birds while fostering the professional development of the ornithological community. By becoming a sponsor of the SCO-SOC 2026 virtual conference, you play a vital role in supporting this important initiative.

### About the Conference

The Society of Canadian Ornithologists holds annual meetings, frequently in collaboration with other societies, to share scientific research and strengthen our conservation community. Our conferences feature a diverse array of workshops, plenary talks, oral and poster sessions, and symposia covering a wide range of topics. We also provide training and professional development opportunities for students and early-career professionals.

This year's conference will be virtual, engaging a broader community of participants from across Canada and beyond. Our last virtual conference was a resounding success, engaging more than 175 participants, which we anticipate we will exceed in 2026. Approximately half of our attendees will hold advanced degrees and conduct bird-related research at universities, provincial and federal agencies, private industry, or environmental NGOs focused on conservation and the biology of wild birds. The other half will comprise amateur ornithologists and students, who will be the next generation of avian conservation practitioners in Canada.

### Why Sponsor the SCO-SOC 2026 Virtual Conference?
