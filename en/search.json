    "text": "Social Media Policy\nThe 2026 meeting of the SCO-SOC supports the use of social media; we encourage thoughtful and considerate sharing of conference content. In our view, sharing ornithological science with the public via social media is one tool for public education and outreach and a key part of gaining long-term support for science and conservation.\nWe encourage presenters to include personal and/or project social media handles, project hashtags or QR codes to external content on their slides (at least the opening/title slide, but recommended to use on all slides) and posters. For those without personal/project handles or hashtags, consider including the conference hashtag (#SCOSOC2026) or a social media icon on slides to let people know you are supportive of them posting about your work on social media.\nAny presenters not wanting their presentation or research to be featured in social media posts must explicitly opt out of social media: this is best achieved by placing a “no social media” symbol on slides or materials. If presenters do not opt out in this manner, it shall be implied that conference organizers and/or attendees can share published research presented at the conference without consent.\nAnyone may participate in conversations on the host societies’ social media channels; however, please be aware that:\n\nCredit must be given to presenters/researchers whose presentation and/or research are featured in your post.\nThe host society has the right to delete posts or comments containing spam, irrelevant remarks, or items that do not align with their mission/integrity.\nPersonal attacks, promotion of violence or illegal activities, offensive material, or profanity will be deleted.\n\nThe host society reserves the right to ban users who violate this policy.\nConference attendees are expected to abide by the meeting code of conduct (above), and all those engaging on social media are asked to maintain apply the same respectful, courteous, inclusive, and supportive conduct online as in person to ensure a safe, hospitable, and productive conference. Discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation will not be tolerated.\nAdditionally, we recommended that presenters and those sharing on social media be mindful of how photos of birds (and other animals) and their nests may appear to the public: Are safe and taxonomically appropriate grips being used? Does the bird appear in any way to be stressed, disheveled, or in an unnatural position? For suggestions on sharing photos of birds in the hand, see guidelines provided by the North American Banding Council at https://nabanding.net/passerines/photographic-guidelines/ . In addition, ask yourself if the use of a nest photo is helping to demonstrate something regarding your methods or results rather than just providing an interesting backdrop. For further guidelines on ethical photography of birds and their nests, see https://www.audubon.org/get-outside/audubons-guide-ethical-bird-photography ."
